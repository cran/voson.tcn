Twitter Conversation Networks and Analysis. This package uses the Twitter API v2 [Early Access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/early-access) endpoints to collect tweets and generate networks for threaded conversations identified using the new tweet [conversation identifier](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/conversation-id).

An introduction to the Twitter API v2 can be found [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/early-access), and the Twitter Developer Application that includes early access [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access).

### OAuth Authentication

This package currently uses app based authentication approach with an `OAuth2` bearer token rather than a user based one that uses an `OAuth1a` token. Bearer tokens have read-only API access and higher rate-limits, whereas user tokens have lower rate-limits and broader permissions that are not required for searching and collecting tweets. To retrieve a bearer token, both the `consumer key` and `consumer secret` for a Developer `Standard Project` or `Academic Research Project` app (that has been approved to use the Twitter API v2 endpoints) are required. These can be found or created on the Twitter Developer Portals [Projects & Apps](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps) page. If you already have your bearer token you can also assign it directly to a `voson.tcn` token object using the `bearer` string parameter.

### Search Endpoint

By default the `recent` search endpoint is used that makes available for collection only tweets that were made within the last 7 days. If the user has an `Academic Research Project` they can also use the `tcn_threads` parameter `endpoint = "all"` to collect on `full-archive` conversation tweets.

If collecting on historical tweets a `start_time = "2021-03-18T00:00:00Z"` datetime parameter will need to be specified if the conversation is older than 30 days old (the default API search start time). The datetime is in UTC and ISO 8601 format passed as a string.  

### Rate-limits

The API `recent search` endpoint where the conversation tweets are retrieved from has a rate-limit of 450 requests per 15 min (per app). A single request can retrieve 100 tweets, translating to an upper limit of 45,000 tweets per 15 mins. The `full-archive search` allows 300 requests of 500 tweets, translating to 150,000 tweets per 15 mins. There is also a limit of only 1 request per second for the `full-archive search` endpoint.

The `tweet lookup` endpoint used by `tcn_tweets` has a rate-limit of 300 requests of 100 tweets (30,000) per 15 minutes.

### Tweet Caps

There is currently a cap of 500 thousand tweets that be collected per month per project under the Twitter API v2 `Standard` product track, and 10 million for the `Academic Research` track. These caps only apply to certain API endpoints, such as `recent` and `full-archive search`. The `voson.tcn` `tcn_threads` function uses the search endpoints and therefore contributes towards this cap, however the `tcn_tweets` function does not.

Project caps are only able to be checked from the [Twitter Developer Console Dashboard](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard).

### Limitations

- Checks and reports on rate-limiting, but does not currently wait until reset time when the rate-limit has been reached.
- Does not yet support OAuth1a authentication as there is no current use case.
- Does not currently collect additional user metadata for authors of tweets that were quoted and are external to the conversation. This can result in incomplete actor node metadata for some quoted tweets: `user_A --replies--> user_B --quotes--> (external user_NA)`
- Handles but does not report on broken reply chains caused by deleted tweets or suspended users. These can result in a disconnected graph with additional components.

## Installation

Install the latest release via CRAN:
``` r
install.packages("voson.tcn")
```

Install the latest development version:
```R
library(remotes)

install_github("vosonlab/voson.tcn")
```

## Usage

### Get Access Token

Retrieve and save an app bearer token using its consumer keys.
```R
library(voson.tcn)

token <- tcn_token(consumer_key = "xxxxxxxx",
                   consumer_secret = "xxxxxxxx")

# alternatively a bearer token string can be assigned directly
token <- tcn_token(bearer = "xxxxxxxx")

# if you save the token to file this step only needs to be done once
saveRDS(token, "~/.tcn_token")
```

### Collect Conversation Tweets

Using tweet urls collect conversation tweets and metadata to generate networks.
```R
# read token from file
token <- readRDS("~/.tcn_token")

# choose a twitter conversation thread or multiple threads to collect
# e.g https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1372615159311699970, and
#     https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1372487989385965569

# can use any tweet or tweet id that is part of the conversation thread
# input is a list of tweet ids, tweet urls or combination of both
tweet_ids <- c("https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1372615159311699970",
               "1372487989385965569")

# collect the conversation thread tweets for supplied ids           
tweets <- tcn_threads(tweet_ids, token)

# academic track historical endpoint - specify start_time and optionally end_time
tweets <- tcn_threads(tweet_ids, token = token,
                      endpoint = "all",
                      start_time = "2021-03-17T00:00:00Z")
```

The `tcn_threads` function produces a named list comprising a dataframe with tweets and metadata and a dataframe of users metadata.

*Note: If using the standard product track only recent search API requests can be performed. No tweets older than 7 days will be collected in the conversation search. The tweets and any directly referenced tweets for the tweet id's provided will still be collected however.* 

```r
names(tweets)
# [1] "tweets" "users" "errors" "meta"
nrow(tweets$tweets)
# [1] 147
nrow(tweets$users)
# [1] 118
nrow(tweets$errors)
# [1] 0
nrow(tweets$meta)
# [1] 2
```

### Collect Specific Tweets

Using tweet urls or id's it's also possible collect specific tweets and their metadata.
```R
# read token from file
token <- readRDS("~/.tcn_token")

# choose tweets to collect
# e.g https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1372615159311699970, and
#     https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1372487989385965569

tweet_ids <- c("https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1372615159311699970",
               "1372487989385965569")

# collect the tweets for supplied ids           
tweets <- tcn_tweets(tweet_ids, token)

names(tweets)
# [1] "tweets" "users" "errors"
nrow(tweets$tweets)
# [1] 2
nrow(tweets$users)
# [1] 1
nrow(tweets$errors)
# [1] 0
```

### Generate Networks

Two types of networks can be generated from the tweets collected. An `activity` network in which tweets are the nodes and an `actor` network where Twitter users are the nodes. Edges are the relationships between nodes, in both networks these are either a `reply` or a `quote`, signifying for example that a tweet is a reply-to another tweet or that a user has replied to another user.

#### Create an activity network

The activity network has tweet metadata such as tweet metrics and author usernames as node attributes.

```R
activity_net <- tcn_network(tweets, "activity")

# activity nodes dataframe structure
print(activity_net$nodes, n = 3)

# # A tibble: 148 x 11
#   tweet_id  user_id  source created_at text    public_metrics.~ public_metrics.~
#   <chr>     <chr>    <chr>  <chr>      <chr>              <int>            <int>

# # ... with 145 more rows, and 4 more variables:
# #   public_metrics.like_count <int>, public_metrics.quote_count <int>,
# #   profile.name <chr>, profile.username <chr>

# activity edges dataframe structure
print(activity_net$edges, n = 3)

# # A tibble: 122 x 3
#   from                to                  type      
#   <chr>               <chr>               <chr>

# # ... with 119 more rows
```

#### Create an actor network

The actor network has additional user profile metadata as node attributes.

```R
actor_net <- tcn_network(tweets, "actor")

# actor nodes dataframe structure
print(actor_net$nodes, n = 3)

# # A tibble: 105 x 13
#   user_id source profile.name profile.profile~ profile.location profile.username
#   <chr>   <chr>  <chr>        <chr>            <chr>            <chr>

# #   profile.public_metrics.following_count <int>,
# #   profile.public_metrics.tweet_count <int>,
# #   profile.public_metrics.listed_count <int>

# actor edges dataframe structure
print(actor_net$edges, n = 3)

# # A tibble: 124 x 6
#   from       to     type  tweet_id    created_at     text                       
#   <chr>      <chr>  <chr> <chr>       <chr>          <chr>

### Network Graphs

Convert network to an igraph object and perform a simple plot of an actor network with node and edge labels.
```R
library(igraph)

g <- graph_from_data_frame(actor_net$edges, vertices = actor_net$nodes)

# plot graph
plot(g, layout = layout_with_fr(g),
     vertex.label = V(g)$profile.username,
     edge.label = E(g)$type,
     vertex.size = 3, edge.arrow.size = 0.2)
```
